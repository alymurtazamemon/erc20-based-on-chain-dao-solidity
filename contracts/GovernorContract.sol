/*
 * 1) how voting power is determined.
 * we will use the GovernorVotes module, which hooks to an IVotes instance to determine the voting power of an account based on the token balance they hold when a proposal becomes active. This module requires as a constructor parameter the address of the token.
 *
 * 2) how many votes are needed for quorum.
 * we will use GovernorVotesQuorumFraction which works together with ERC20Votes to define quorum as a percentage of the total supply at the block a proposalâ€™s voting power is retrieved. This requires a constructor parameter to set the percentage. Most Governors nowadays use 4%, so we will initialize the module with parameter 4 (this indicates the percentage, resulting in 4%).
 *
 * 3) what options people have when casting a vote and how those votes are counted.
 * we will use GovernorCountingSimple, a module that offers 3 options to voters: For, Against, and Abstain, and where only For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.
 *
 * 4) What GovernorTimelockControl contract does?
 * It is good practice to add a timelock to governance decisions. This allows users to exit the system if they disagree with a decision before it is executed.
 *
 * Besides these modules, Governor itself has some parameters we must set.

 * votingDelay: How long after a proposal is created should voting power be fixed. A large voting delay gives users time to unstake tokens if necessary.

 * votingPeriod: How long does a proposal remain open to votes.

 * These parameters are specified in number of blocks. Assuming block time of around 13.14 seconds, we will set votingDelay = 1 day = 6570 blocks, and votingPeriod = 1 week = 45992 blocks.

 * We can optionally set a proposal threshold as well. This restricts proposal creation to accounts who have enough voting power.
